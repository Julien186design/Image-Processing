Image-Processing
A C++ project for manipulating image pixels in fun ways.
This project is based on Code-Break0's work. I add my own modifications to create cool effects with images.

How to Run the Code?
To run the code, you need to create two folders: "Input" and "Output".

"Input" must contain the pictures you want to modify. Organize them in subfolders, for example: Input/Cake/Oreo cake.jpg.

"Output" must contain the following subfolders:
120, BTB, BTOW, BTW, WTB, WTOB, WTW.

Note: The value 120 was chosen arbitrarily—feel free to modify or remove it.

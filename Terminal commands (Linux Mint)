Deleting all files in a folder (subfolders included).
find . -type f -delete

Getting all unique filenames in the "One Color" folder by cutting after "- Tolerance". Delete "Output/One Color" to run in the current folder.
find "Output/One Color" -type f   -printf '%f\n' | sed 's/ - Tolerance.*//' | sort -u

Getting all unique filenames whose name contains "Or".
find -type f -name "*Or*" -printf '%f\n' | sed 's/ - .*//' | sort -u

Getting the names of the 20 largest files (useful to launch in the "Output" folder if processing time is getting important)
find . -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort --human-numeric-sort --reverse | head -n 20

Renaming all files whose name begin by "ABC-" to delete the first 4 characters. ("ABC-" is for the example)
for f in "ABC-"*; do   mv "$f" "${f#ABC-}"; done
